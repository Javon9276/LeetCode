# 195. Tenth Line
How would you print just the 10th line of a file?

For example, assume that `file.txt` has the following content:
```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
```
Your script should output the tenth line, which is:
```
Line 10
```
Hint:
1. If the file contains less than 10 lines, what should you output?
2. There's at least three different solutions. Try to explore all possibilities.

# 195. 第十行
怎么只打印一个文件中的第十行？

例如，假定 `file.txt` 有如下内容：
```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
```
你的脚本应当显示第十行，如下：
```
Line 10
```
提示:
1. 如果一个文件少于十行，你怎么显示？
2. 至少有三种不同的方法，尝试尽可能所有的方法。
